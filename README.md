# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes COVID-19 trends using Python for data cleaning/EDA and Power BI for interactive dashboards. 


## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore global COVID-19 trends and deliver actionable insights through data analysis and interactive visualizations.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Collection and Cleaning

- Imported global COVID-19 datasets
- Standardized and cleaned column values
- Removed missing and anomalous entries (e.g., negative active cases)
- Created new calculated fields such as Active Cases = Confirmed - Deaths - Recovered

### Milestone 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted descriptive statistics and trend analysis
- Analyzed confirmed, death, recovered, and active case patterns over time
- Used correlation heatmaps to study relationships between variables

### Documentation

- Summarized all findings, methodology, and visualizations in a PDF format
- Included charts and observations to support key insights

## Interactive Dashboards

Two dashboards were built in Power BI to provide interactive exploration of COVID-19 data.


## Dashboard Details

The Power BI dashboard is included in the repository as a PDF file (`Power BI.pdf`). It includes:
- A WHO Region slicer for filtering
- A map view showing confirmed cases by region
- A time-series line chart showing case trends over months

## View Dashboard (PDF)

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for analysis and plotting
- Power BI for dashboard development
- CSV and PDF for data and reporting

## Files Included
